# Screenshot Sync - Seamless Screenshot Transfer from Mac to Android üì∏üì±

This project is a simple solution to transfer screenshots from your Mac to your Android device using FTP. Whenever you take a screenshot on your Mac, it will be automatically uploaded to a specific directory on your Android device, making it easier to access your files without manual transfers.

### üõ†Ô∏è **How to Use**
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iamsagar99/SyncFiles.git
   cd SyncFiles
   ```

2. **Run the Script on Your Mac**:
   Update the FTP credentials in the `ftp_server.py` file and then run the script:

   The script will start monitoring your screenshots folder and will automatically upload new screenshots to your Android device.

3. **Run the FTP Client on Android**:
   Download termux and install python on it. And just add `ftp_client.py` on your directory run the command:
    ```bash

### ü§î **What Drives Me to Build This**

I was watching a class recording and taking notes on my Android tablet. I found myself spending too much time recreating tables and charts that were already in the video. That‚Äôs when I thought, why not automate this?

So, I built a simple FTP server to automatically transfer whatever screenshots I take on my Mac to my Android tablet. This project made my workflow much more efficient, and I hope it can do the same for you!

Now, you can take screenshots on your Mac, and they‚Äôll be automatically transferred to your Android device!
