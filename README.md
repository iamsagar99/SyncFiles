### üõ†Ô∏è **How to Use**
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/iamsagar99/SyncFiles.git
   cd SyncFiles
   ```

2. **Run the Script on Your Computer**:
   Update the FTP credentials in the `ftp_server.py` file and then run the script:
   ```bash
   python ftp_server.py && python screenshot_monitor.py
   ```

   The script will start monitoring the folder where your files are created (such as the screenshot folder) and automatically upload new files to your Android device.

3. **Run the FTP Client on Android**:
   Download **Termux** on your Android device and install Python. Then, add the `ftp_client.py` file to your directory and run the following command:
   ```bash
   python ftp_client.py
   ```

   Your files will be available in the folder you've specified on your Android device.

### ü§î **What Drives Me to Build This**

I was watching a class recording and taking notes on my Android tablet. I found myself spending too much time recreating tables and charts that were already in the video. That's when I thought: why not automate this?

So, I built a simple FTP server to automatically transfer screenshots and other files from my Mac to my Android tablet. It turned out to be a huge time-saver, and I wanted to make this solution available to others who might be facing similar issues.
